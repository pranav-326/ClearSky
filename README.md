# ClearSky
 ClearSky is a cross-platform website that provides real-time weather updates for your current location using a REST APIs of weather and a UV index. What makes ClearSky unique is its ability to calculate your safe sun exposure time based on your Fitzpatrick skin type.  I have integrated Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for easier styling and management, and used EJS and Node.js to dynamically customize colors based on the time of day and UV index.
